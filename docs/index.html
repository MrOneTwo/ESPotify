  <h4>RFID reader</h4>

  <p>I've started with the RC522 chip based reader. Unfortunately the quality is dissapointing.
  Apparently it doesn't even use inductors with correct values.</p>

  <p>I've ordered two readers using PN532 chip. A YouTube video shows it to perform way better
  than the one using RC522 chip.</p>
