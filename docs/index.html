  <h4>RFID reader</h4>

  <p>I've started with the RC522 chip based reader. Unfortunately the quality is dissapointing.
  Apparently it doesn't even use inductors with correct values (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98GXrixOM4c).</p>

  <p>I've ordered two readers using PN532 chip. A YouTube video shows it to perform way better
  than the one using RC522 chip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMTPWwRxgQg).</p>
